Hi, I'm Clara. I work at UCL as a Research Fellow in Urban Analytics at the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa). Within CASA, I am part of the [City Modelling Lab (CML)](https://citymodellinglab.github.io), where we focus on developing spatial analytics methods, data, and tools to improve our understanding on complex urban challenges.

From February 2026, I am part of the new cohort of [Smart Data Research UK Fellows](https://www.sdruk.ukri.org/2026/02/12/15-new-smart-data-research-fellowships/). My project, GeoMobility: Geodemographics for Equitable Mobility Futures, will produce mobility profiles at fine spatial scales. This will help us better understand the diversity in people's travel patterns and provide more nuanced and better targeted transport policies.


I’m particularly interested in how people engage in their daily activities, and how this results into different activity chains that vary from person to person. A central question driving my work is: how well do transport systems actually accommodate this diversity of travel and activity patterns? Where do they fall short? What inequalities derive from this mismatch? Methodologically, I work primarily with survey data, though I’m open to exploring any mobility-related data source.
