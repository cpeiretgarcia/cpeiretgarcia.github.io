Hi, I'm Clara. I work at UCL as a Research Fellow in Urban Analytics at the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa). Within CASA, I am part of the [City Modelling Lab (CML)](https://citymodellinglab.github.io), where we focus on developing spatial analytics methods, data, and tools to improve our understanding on complex urban challenges.

I’m particularly interested in how people engage in their daily activities, and how this results into different activity chains that vary from person to person. A central question driving my work is: how well do transport systems actually accommodate this diversity of travel and activity patterns? Where do they fall short? What inequalities derive from this mismatch? Methodologically, I work primarily with survey data, though I’m open to exploring any mobility-related data source.
