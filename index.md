Hi, I'm Clara. I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL. I am interested in the use of new methods and data sets for improving decision making in transport and planning.
This is my personal website, where I will try my best to share my work, publications, and more.
