Hi, I'm Clara — a Research Fellow in Urban Analytics at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL. My work explores how spatial data can be used to understand and address urban inequalities through more inclusive policy and planning. I'm particularly interested in developing and applying new methods and data sources to identify which groups and areas are most likely to be disadvantaged — and how we can use that insight to inform better decision making.

Alongside my current role, I’m completing a PhD in Geospatial Systems at Newcastle University. My research focuses on how survey-based data can help identify different activity and mobility profiles in cities, and how these groups experience inequalities in accessibility and mobility. A key strand of this work involves developing more inclusive metrics that reflect the diverse needs of urban populations.

I'm also part of the <a href="https://citymodellinglab.uk/" target="_blank">CASA/Arup City Modelling Lab</a>, a collaboration between UCL and Arup that bridges academic research and practical decision making. The lab creates tools and methods to support urban leaders in responding to challenges like climate change and social inequality. Within the lab, I work on projects involving small area estimation for urban mobility and energy use, and the development of synthetic population data for human-centric urban modelling.

Outside of work, I enjoy live music, playing the guitar and learning the drums, trying out new food spots, and spending time in nature.
