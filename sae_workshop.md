Small Area Estimation (SAE) is a statistical methodology that allows us to improve the precision of our estimates when we work with survey data for which sample sizes are limited or even zero. As part of our work at the CASA/Arup City Modelling Lab, we have been developing a SAE workshop that introduces the basic concepts and methods of SAE, with a focus on practical applications using R. The workshop is designed to be accessible to a general audicence, including those with limited statistical background. You can find the workshop slides below.
